# Nebulights

Nebulights uses your microphone to listen to the audio around you to make the lights respond to music.  

Nebulights only uses the microphone when you have enabled, can be disabled from the menu, and always starts disabled.

No audio records are kept, or used for any other purpose than to make the lights respond to music.
